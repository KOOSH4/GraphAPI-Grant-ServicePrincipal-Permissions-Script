Description:

This GitHub repository contains a PowerShell script designed to grant specific permissions to the service principal associated with a Logic App. The granted permissions enable seamless access to the Microsoft Graph, enhancing the Logic App's effectiveness in interacting with the Graph API.
Instructions:

- Install the AzureAD PowerShell module:

````powershell
    Install-Module AzureAD
````

- Obtain the ObjectID of the service principal associated with your Logic App.

- Connect to Azure AD using Connect-AzureAD.
